No, the title isn\'t some cool metaphor - this post really is about
changing the oil. Anyway, the quick change places would have you change
your oil every 3,000 miles. HOWEVER, they want to sell you oil, so they
might be erring on the side of caution, so to speak. My car\'s
manufacturer recommends changing the oil every 10,000 miles. HOWEVER,
they want to sell me a new car. So, after many years of wondering about
this conundrum, I\'ve decided that the sweet spot between unnecessary
oil changes and waiting too long must lie between those two extremes.
Hey, it sounds good, right? So, I\'m going to go 6,500 miles between oil
changes.
