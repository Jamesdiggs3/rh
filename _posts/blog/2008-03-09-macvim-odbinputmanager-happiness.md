So, MacOS offers some emacs key bindings through-out the OS. Great, you
say -\
but I use vi, and I don\'t want to waste years of muscle memory! (This
makes you\
a big geek, by the way - I\'ve come to terms with it\...) So, you have
two options\
- you can:

a\) Install [viAllOver](http://www.dabble.org/viallover/) and hack on\
it till it more or less works the way you expect and then realize that
it still\
doesn\'t work for Safari textfields, and that this is less than ideal
when you\'re\
starting a blog\... (this method also requires run-on sentences,
apparently.)

b\) Install [MacVim](http://code.google.com/p/macvim/), and the
ODBInputManager plugin.\
Now, you can just select \'Edit in MacVim\' from the Edit menu, (or of
course a configurable\
keyboard shortcut) and have the text you\'re editing instantly pop up in
MacVim. Edit to\
your heart\'s content, and just save and close the document when you\'re
done. It pops right\
up in whatever app you were using before. Bliss\...
