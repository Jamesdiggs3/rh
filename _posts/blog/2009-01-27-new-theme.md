My blog is back from the dead! Well, maybe for the day, anyway\... (had
the day off from work because of an ice storm) I decided to jazz it up a
little, and installed the excellent
[nitobe](http://drupal.org/project/nitobe) theme. It\'s pretty much bone
stock, except for the header images, which were all taken by me or my
wife. If you\'re curious where any of them were taken, just post a
comment and I\'ll be happy to tell ya\...
