So in an [earlier
post](http://reluctanthacker.rollett.org/content/recommended-safari-clicktoflash),
I complained about
[vimperator](http://vimperator.org/trac/wiki/Vimperator) not being
available for Safari. Well, like anyone else that\'s completely nuts
would do, I decided to pull myself up by my own bootstraps and have a
go. You may find (and install) my limited but functional beginnings
[here](http://reluctanthacker.rollett.org/software/vimafarian).
