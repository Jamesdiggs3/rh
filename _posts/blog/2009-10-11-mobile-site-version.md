Had fun messing with
[dashcode](http://developer.apple.com/tools/dashcode/) today. Takes very
little time to build a little web app based on an rss feed, and the end
result is a mobile version of this site
[here](http://reluctanthacker.rollett.org/i/). It even works when
offline in Safari, though not when added to the homescreen, for some
reason I can\'t yet fathom. Short link dump:

-   Drupal [mobile tools](http://drupal.org/project/mobile_tools)
-   Cache manifest

-   Building [offline
    webapps](http://www.thecssninja.com/javascript/how-to-create-offline-webapps-on-the-iphone)
    on the iPhone

enjoy!
