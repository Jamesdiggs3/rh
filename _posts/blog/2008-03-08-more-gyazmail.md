Anyway, it\'s been a while since the previous post, but luckily, I have
no\
readers.

I have been very pleased with gyazmail in the time I\'ve been trying it
out,\
and have gone ahead and bought it. At only 18 bills, it\'s probably one
of\
the times I\'ve been happiest to pay for software ever. I\'m all for the
free\
option, especially if it\'s open source, but there just isn\'t a client
out\
there that is as easy for me to use, and at least more or less keep up
with\
the flood of email there is to deal with.

The biggest reason is that I never have to take my hands off the
keyboard -\
the only widget I\'ve found that isn\'t tabbable and has no keyboard
shortcut\
is the select menu for a message search. Message filing is super-speedy
- I\
don\'t like filing new mail into folders, because the end result is that
I\
never see it. However, gyazmail will let you set up filters to be
applyed\
manually. So, I set up my filters, and then just hit the keystroke of my
choice\
when I\'m done looking at a message. Bam!

The default font for most views is inexplicably set to Helvetica, but a
quick\
change to Lucida Grande leaves it as pretty and easy to read as
Mail.app.

As I mentioned before, viAllOver works, so the muscle memory of years
isn\'t all\
for naught when I\'m writing longer emails.

My only real wishes are for greater applescript support, (so I could
script\
replying to messages and adding the necessary cc\'s and reply-to\'s for
work)\
and collapsible/highlighted threads. It does have threaded view, but
just\
works by indenting messages that are in a thread. The last mentioned is
the\
only real win I see for Mail.app, because one should be able to write
an\
applescript to do what I mentioned, but can\'t, because there are too
many bugs\
in Apple\'s implementation. (You can reply to a message, but it won\'t
pass back\
a reference to the message you just created - nice.)
