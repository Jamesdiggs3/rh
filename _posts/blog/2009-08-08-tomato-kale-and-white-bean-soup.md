Background\
We recently joined a [CSA](http://www.localharvest.org/csa/), and
although we haven\'t received our first share yet, we\'ve already been
trying to integrate more fruits and vegetables in our diet. Two nights
ago, we had a delicious salad with romaine,
[kale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kale) and grilled chicken, peppers
and onions. We loved it, but the kale was a bit\... tough. We had some
kale in a salad at a friend\'s house that must have been a different
variety, because it was much better raw. Anyway, I was making dinner
tonight, and tried to figure out a way to make kale a less robust part
of the meal. Here\'s what I came up with:

Ingredients

-   one bunch kale (4-5 large leaves or so)
-   one (14oz) can white northern beans
-   2 cups chicken broth
-   2 cups water
-   1/2 red onion
-   1 large clove garlic
-   4-5 medium sized tomatoes
-   olive oil
-   balsamic vinegar
-   spices

Directions

Chop onion. (I used leftover grilled onions, and they were delicious)
Take a 4qt saucepan, and saut√© the onion in olive oil on medium heat. As
it is sauteeing, crush the garlic into the pan, and add 1 tsp rosemary
and 1 tsp thyme. (fresh is great if you have it) While this is going on,
you can cut your kale into bite-size pieces. Once the onions are soft,
add the chicken broth, water, kale and beans. (don\'t bother draining
the beans, just toss it all in) Add 1/2 tsp fennel seeds, 2 tsps chopped
parsley, 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes, and 1/2 tsp coriander seeds. (if
you\'re a big coriander fan, add more by all means - they add a
wonderful flavor, in my opinion) Also add 3/4 tsp balsamic vinegar.
Bring to a boil and allow to simmer for 30-40 minutes, or until the kale
is al dente. Now would be a good time to chop your tomatoes into
bite-sized pieces.

Add the tomatoes 5 minutes before you\'re ready to eat, to allow them to
heat up without getting too soft. You can add salt to taste, or do so at
the table.

Serving

Serve hot, optionally with a bit of good olive oil or grated parmesan.
Serve as a side dish, or with hot whole grain bread as a complete meal.

Variations\
This would probably also be good with italian sausage. Haven\'t tried it
that way, though.
