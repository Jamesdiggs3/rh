I made this the other night from what looked good and was on sale at the
store, and it turned out pretty well - so, I thought I would share what
I came up with.

Ingredients:\
1 head Romaine lettuce\
1 good sized tomato\
2-3 oz. Chevre (goat cheese)\
3-4 pieces bacon\
1 small avocado\
mustard powder\
garlic powder\
cayenne pepper\
nutmeg\
italian seasoning\
salt\
pepper\
olive oil\
balsamic vinegar

Cook bacon. Wash Lettuce, and chop the head into 3/4 inch wide strips.
Dice the tomato, slice the avocado, and add to the lettuce. Cut bacon
into small pieces, and throw it into the mix. Add all seasonings to
taste, and toss with oil, vinegar, and the goat cheese. We thought it
was delicious!
