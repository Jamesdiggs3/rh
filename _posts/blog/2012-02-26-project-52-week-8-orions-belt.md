Inspired by a combination of having recently read a [fantastic book
about the Palomar
telescope](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060926708?ie=UTF8&tag=thereluhack-20&linkCode=shr&camp=213733&creative=393177&creativeASIN=0060926708&ref_=sr_1_1&qid=1330230406&sr=8-1)
and having recently seen some inspiring astrophotography, I decided to
try my hand at a little of my own. I ran across some very nice
[beginner\'s tips](http://www.gyes.eu/astro/camera_settings.htm) and
spent some time shooting in my driveway this evening. This image is a
stack of 3 10 second exposures (without a tracking mount, one can\'t do
very long exposures without getting star trails. Orion\'s belt is in the
center, and I\'m quite pleased for a first attempt! The image links to a
full-size version, which does the subject slightly more justice.
