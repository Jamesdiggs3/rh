Hope this helps someone - if you copy your old disk on to a new one when
upgrading, and then have strange networking problems, uninstall [Little
Snitch](http://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/index.html) and
reboot. Of course, if you never had it installed, this tip probably
won\'t help you! In particular, some applications could access the
\'net, and others just sat and hung. Luckily I figured it out after just
a couple minutes, or I would really have been leaving some head-shaped
indentations in the desk\...
