I picked up a used camera for a sort of knock-about second camera the
other day - it's a [Samsung
GX-1L](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DZFT8U?ie=UTF8&tag=thereluhack-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000DZFT8U),
and so far I'm very happy with it.

These pictures were all taken around
[Southlake's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southlake,_Texas) town
square.
