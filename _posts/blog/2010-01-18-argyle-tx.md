Had the day off in remembrance of MLK, and Kelly had to work, so I
decided to go on walkabout. Wanted to take a hike, but the trail I had
in mind was muddy, and therefore closed. On the way, I stopped through
Argyle and took a few pics.

Presumable the HS mascot.

The squad cars were much nicer than the sign!
