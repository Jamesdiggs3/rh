I got a great deal on a [fisheye
lens](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CNI016?ie=UTF8&tag=thereluhack-20&linkCode=shr&camp=213733&creative=393185&creativeASIN=B000CNI016&redirect=true&ref_=s9_simh_gw_p421_d1_g421_i1)
this morning via Craigslist, so of course it was glued to the camera
most of the day. There's definitely a learning curve to taking good
(and/or appropriate!) shots with the lens, but I liked how this captures
the feel of a small person in a big environment.
