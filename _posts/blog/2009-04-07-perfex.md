I appreciate good tools wherever I find them - whether they be software,
rhetorical, or physical. We ran across a [Perfex pepper
mill](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZGYZCI?ie=UTF8&tag=thereluhack-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000ZGYZCI)
at Sur La Table several weeks ago, and instantly fell in love. Compact
and dense, with a little door to load peppercorns without any
dissasembly - perfect! Only one problem - good luck finding one for less
than seventy bucks\... Cheap as I am, this was a problem.

After a little sleuthing on ebay, I found a mill in somewhat less than
perfect condition, but at just over twenty bucks shipped, I had to pull
the trigger. I haven't regretted it for a second, because it is not the
most beautiful specimen, but after a little bit of TLC, it is great at
its job.

the logo - this company has been making these to the same design for
over 50 years. (according to the infallible interweb)

the internal machinery after a good cleaning - love that burr grinder.
