Trying out the new [Safari 4
beta](http://www.apple.com/safari/download/) today. Working very nicely
so far - fast, light on cpu, etc. Still, I don\'t know if I can go on
for too long without
[vimperator](http://vimperator.org/trac/wiki/Vimperator)! Anyway, the
point of this post was to recommend
[ClickToFlash](http://github.com/rentzsch/clicktoflash/tree/master). It
does a nice job of blocking flash plugins, but also lets you whitelist
by URL, which is nice for those few sites that you do want to see flash
stuff on\...
