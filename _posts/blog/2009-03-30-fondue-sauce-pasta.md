Whipped this up the other night, and we enjoyed it, so I thought I\'d
share. Convergence nearly gaurantees that a similar or identical recipe
exists elsewhere, but I believe that I still get to call this a
original, since I\'m ignorant of any prior art\... All measurements are
approximate, modify to suit.

3/4 c. dry white wine (I used Cabernet Sauvignon)\
1/2 c. good Parmesan cheese, grated (feel free to subsitute Gruyere,
Emmenthaler, or a blend)\
1/4 t. salt\
1/3 c. half & half (or milk)\
1 T. flour

Heat most of the wine in a saucier until small bubbles start to form.
Gradually stir in cheese with a whisk until completely melted, then add
the half & half + salt. Mix the flour with the remaining wine in a
shaker, and then add to slightly thicken the sauce. Serve immediately
over the pasta of your choice.

When writing about food, I feel it incumbent upon myself to link [The
Captain\'s Table](http://capitalck.blogspot.com/).
