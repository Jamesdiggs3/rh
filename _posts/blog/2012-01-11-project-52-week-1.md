Inspired by [this
post](http://brightcloudyday.wordpress.com/2012/01/07/project-52-week-1/),
I\'ve decided to make the effort to take and post at least one photo a
week this year. I didn\'t decide this until today, but luckily I have a
shot taken on the first. It\'s just a test shot of a squirrel, taken
with a new-to-me [200mm telephoto
lens](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013HAC0C?ie=UTF8&tag=thereluhack-20&linkCode=shr&camp=213733&creative=393177&creativeASIN=B0013HAC0C&ref_=pd_sim_p_28).
The depth of field is so thin at Æ’/2.8 that the lower half of the
squirrel appears to be in better focus than the top, unless it\'s the
fact that I was shooting at 1/60th of a second, image stabilization or
no!
