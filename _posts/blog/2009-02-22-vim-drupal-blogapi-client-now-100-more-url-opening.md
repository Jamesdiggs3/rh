Decided I was tired of having to manually go and look at my posts after
I was done writing them\... This [latest
version](http://reluctanthacker.rollett.org/software/drupavim) will open
the post under your cursor in your default browser when you type \'o\'.
whoo! Tested and working on mac os x, could be dodgier on linux/windoze
- leave a comment if you have trouble\...
