message: "I am trying to understand what the (^\\|[^0-9]\\)\\{1\\} and \\($\\|[^0-9]\\)\\{1\\}
  are for in the expression, The ^ $ seem to be limiting since it must be a credit
  card on it on line, i not sure what the 0-9 at the start and end are for. \r\n\r\nSo
  \ the following would seem to be more useful\r\n\r\necho \"5105105105105100\" |grep
  -o '\\([345]\\{1\\}[0-9]\\{3\\}\\|6011\\)\\{1\\}[ -]\\?[0-9]\\{4\\}[ -]\\?[0-9]\\{2\\}[-]\\?[0-9]\\{2\\}[
