message: "Wow, that's one sweet demo :D.\r\n\r\nI'm a little embarrassed to admit
  this but I don't really know how to use git, so I'll have to look into that first
  :P. But with that DB storage API I'm really interested in writing some serious code.
  It would also enable multi-key commands, making gt (among other commands) possible.\r\n\r\nI
  was also thinking about the \"statusbar\" that vimperator provides.. Do you have
  any suggestions as to how one would go about to implement a similar feature? My
  thoughts immediately go to adding a div that is above everything on the page (really
  high z-index) at the bottom of the screen, but I think it would be ugly in the end
  because of its limitations in its interaction with safari, e.g. would it be possible
  (or even desirable) to have the wget-style loading-bar, among other things?\r\n\r\nAnother
  thing that I'm considering is how to make a statusbar like the one that vimperator
  provides, only better or at least more eye-appealing. In my mind I'm seeing something
  like quicksilver but with a much higher y-value so that it doesn't just barge in
  going \"HAAI GAAAIS\" in the middle of the page.\r\n\r\nThere's one thing that I'm
  really missing from vimperator - hinting to follow links. I'd like to discuss this
  feature and how it would be implemented before delving into it.\r\n\r\n/Emilio"
