message: "I made a copy of the vimafarian file and added it as a new script to be
  able to experiment with it and try out some ideas in a more direct fashion without
  having to reinstall it everytime I broke something.\r\n\r\nWhen I was messing around
  I quickly realized (and checked) that since vimafarian (actually all GreaseKit scripts)
  is loaded on a per tab basis you can't have any global variables like a stack, making
  it impossible to add support for the undo operation that re-opens a closed tab.\r\n\r\nOne
  ugly work-around might be to implement some local ajax service that can act as a
  storage engine for the global vimafarian state. Another might be to use CouchDB,
  a DBMS that natively supports the CRUD-operations via http to implement a similar
  solution.\r\n\r\nIf there are more ways of creating a 'global' state of kinds that
  are more feasible I'd be very interested in contributing, but until then I'll probably
  just use/modify vimafarian as/to be an accessibility aid.\r\n\r\nI'm thinking about
  digging into the vimperator code to see how things are done, especially the hinting
  function, one of the things I've been missing most since I switched back to safari
  from firefox (+vimperator)."
