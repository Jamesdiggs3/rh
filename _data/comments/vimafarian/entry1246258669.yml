message: Fantastic Idea!!  Unfortunately, it seems that many of the hotkeys have become
  broken in Safari 4.  As a fellow Vimperator user that would like to be able to dump
  Firefox for its insane memory hogging, I'm very excited to see this!  I'd love to
  contribute to this.  Perhaps we can bring it up to speed with Safari 4 and work
  on some more basic Vimperator functionality :D
