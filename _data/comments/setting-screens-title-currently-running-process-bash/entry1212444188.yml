message: "I'm glad i found this page. I was desperately trying to do something like
  this.\r\nI have a few questions:\r\necho -ne \"\\ek${1%% *}\\e\\\\\" <- I know what
  that does, but what is it for ?\r\necho -n '' <- why echoing and empty string ?\r\n\r\nAlso
  i see you mixed \\e and \\033 depending on the context (both ESC command) and you're
  a 100% right because using \\e in PS1 doesn't work as expected. Do you know why
