  1 and 2 - good question! Neither are necessary, and must have been a result of the
  different things I tried while I was getting this to work... I'll modify the code
  sample, thanks!\r\n\r\nquestion 3 - the reason (I think) that \\e doesn't work in
  PS1 is because it is an escape only understood by bash's 'echo' built-in, and not
  interpreted in prompts. (see the section on echo in the bash man page)"
