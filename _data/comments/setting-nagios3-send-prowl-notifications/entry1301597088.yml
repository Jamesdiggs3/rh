message: "Hey Adrian. \r\n\r\nAwesome post, works great. But I am cheap and lazy (well
  too busy to edit cfg in vi  every time I add a host)\r\n\r\nDo you have any idea
  on how to incorporate prowl into Opsview ? I have tried but for the life of me,
  the cfg for Opsview is no where near Nagios, or Icinga or Monarch. \r\nI have gotten
  as far as finding where I should put the config for the custom notification, but
  actually getting it to work is another story. \r\n\r\nCheers for the help. \r\n\r\nW
