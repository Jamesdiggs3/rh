message: "Sorry, just nitpicking..\r\n\r\nYour host command definition in the example
  is using $SERVICEDESC$ '$SERVICEOUTPUT$' instead of $HOSTDESC$ $HOSTOUTPUT$, these
  would result in empty variables in the prowl message.\r\n\r\nAlso the path to your
  prowl.pl in the command definitions is /usr/local/nagios3/libexec, but previously
  we wget it to /usr/local/bin\r\n\r\nOtherwise, great! Thanks again."
