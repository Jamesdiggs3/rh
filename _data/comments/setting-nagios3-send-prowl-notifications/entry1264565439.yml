message: "Hi Adrian,\r\n\r\nJust in the middle of setting up the same thing. Thanks
  for your excellent guide.\r\n\r\nJust thought I'd note that if you're on Debian/Ubuntu,
  you'll also need to apt-get install liblwp-useragent-determined-perl if you haven't
  got it already, or else Perl will die with this error:\r\n\r\n<code>\r\nCan't locate
