message: "glad it's working for you! I can think of two ways to accomplish this -
  the first would be to write a wrapper script that sets the priority based on the
  input, and call that instead. The second is what I do - I use nagios escalations
  so that only the truly critical notifications get sent directly to my phone, and
  deal with the rest via email. \r\n\r\ngood luck!"
