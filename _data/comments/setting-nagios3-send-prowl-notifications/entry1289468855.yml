message: "Hi! Thanks for this. Rocks on my system.\r\nQuery about an improvement (that
  might not be possible).\r\n\r\nProwl on my iPhone let's me quiet it during nights
  unless I get an \"emergency\". I know I cant priority to 2 and get that. But is
  it possible, somehow, to set priority based on severity from Nagios?\r\n\r\nIe.
  Warning = Priority 1, Info = Priority 0, Critical = Priority 2.. If it is possible
  somehow.. I'd love it. Why? Because I don't need to run to my computer if it's a
  warning or information - only when theres an emergency.. "
