message: "You have at least one reader. I really like Gyazail, too. I'm using it in
  Leopard instead of Mail. It seems to work more nicely with IMAP than Mail does.
  My main wish will sound trivial, but I wish I could get rid of the \"account/signature
  chooser\" section of the Composer window. I'm only using one account, and I don't
  use signatures, so it's just wasted space for me.\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n"
