message: "> My main wish will sound trivial, but I wish I could get rid of the \"account/signature
  chooser\" section\r\n\r\nwill you shush please? this is one super cool feature and
  of the reasons I use Gyazail. You can not only define multiple identities for the
  same mailbox (me-personal@mail.com, me-business@mail.com). It's also detected  to
  which of these IDs the message was sent choosing automatically the correct \"from\"
  adress when replying to the original sender.\r\nDon't take that away from me please
