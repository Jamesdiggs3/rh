message: "One more idea which i am not able to implement due to lack of proper Python
  knowledge :)\r\n\r\nI know it's possible to post multiple content types using blogapi.
  What about changing command \"e blog/something\" to \"e content_type/something\".
  Therefore \"e story\" or \"n story\" would create a new story, \"n page\" would
  create a new page, etc. Simple \"n\" would still create a blog."
