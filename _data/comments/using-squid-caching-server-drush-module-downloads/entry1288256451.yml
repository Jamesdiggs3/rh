message: "Greetings ...\r\n\r\n This is an awesome idea, but if you using Aegir, you
  can't really pass proxy details to drush and you can't alias it either, because
  the aegir user account is not really a shell, for security reasons.\r\n\r\n So,
  what I did was setup iptables, to forward all outbound http traffic to squid, using
  the following commands ...\r\n\r\niptables -t nat -F  # clear table\r\n\r\n# normal
  transparent proxy\r\niptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp -i eth0 --dport 80 -j
  REDIRECT --to-port 3127\r\n\r\n# handle connections on the same box (SQUIDIP is
  a loopback instance)\r\ngid=`id -g proxy`\r\niptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport
  80 -m owner --gid-owner $gid -j ACCEPT\r\niptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport
  80 -j DNAT --to-destination SQUIDIP:3127\r\n\r\nComplete details at ... http://wiki.squid-cache.org/ConfigExamples/Intercept/LinuxLocalhost\r\n\r\nHope
  that helps other people."
