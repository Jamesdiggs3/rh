message: "Thanks for this post. It took me a while to get it to automatically work
  for drush (eg, w/o having to type the full http_proxy=... bit above). The missing
  piece was to add\r\n<code>\r\nhttp_proxy=http://localhost:3128\r\nftp_proxy=http://localhost:3128\r\nuse_proxy=on\r\n</code>\r\nto
  my .wgetrc file."
