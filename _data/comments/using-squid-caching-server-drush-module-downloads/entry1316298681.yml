message: "Hmmm... in the squid3 access.log, I seem to be getting TCP_CLIENT_REFRESH_MISS
  for all modules when I use the alias:\r\ndrush=\"http_proxy=http://localhost:3128
  drush\"\r\n\r\nFunny, cause when we specify a direct git repo in the make file,
  then we get a TCP_HIT, but it misses for everything else...\r\n\r\nbut hey, drush
  dl works fine, it's just drush make that's giving issue :S\r\n\r\nJust posting in
  case someone else gets the same problem!"
